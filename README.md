# Stareso-Data-Processing

A project to store the tools developped to process the CTD, ADCP and meteorological data acquired in STARESO as well as Sea Surface Temperature data obtained from [Ocean Color](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

## Notebooks

A set of jupyter-notebooks providing examples of how to access the data files through the [RACE database](http://www.gitan.ulg.ac.be/cms/index.php?page=donnees-de-stareso#1.), read the data from the files and create some plots and basic analysis.

## Leaflet

A simple example of a [leaflet](map) displaying the CTD stations along with other layers such as the [EMODnet Bathymetry](http://www.emodnet-bathymetry.eu/).

## Images

Examples of images generated with the notebooks using real observations.
